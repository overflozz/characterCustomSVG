# Character Customization
A simple use of Snaps.svg to create a character customization system.
You can see an example [here](http://chellestudio.fr/charactercustom/).

The code is well documented.

# Disclaimer
I used [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/), [Snapsvg](http://snapsvg.io/docs/) for a simple manipulation of the svg file, Adobe illustrator for the character (and this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2DHodAEZ0A)).

# Installation
There is nothing more than what is here to install. You can clone the depo or download it and unzip it in your folder.

# Using it

This can be easily adapted. I suggest you to take a look at Snapsvg 's [documentation](http://snapsvg.io/docs/) to understand each line, but it won't be difficult in any case.
